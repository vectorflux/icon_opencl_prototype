-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The icon_testbed provides a set of methods from the
ICON project with the purpose of optimizing the
computational performance for differnet architectures.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiling and running
---------------------

Requirements:

You will need a C and Fortran 2003 compiler and the
netcdf 4 library.

Configure:

> ./configure [--with-netcdf=<netcd folder>] [--with-openmp] [--with-fortran=<...>]

The files config/mh-<OS> contain the definitions (compilers, paths, etc)
used in configure. You may modify them according to your installation.
In addition you may create the config/mh-override, defining parameters
that will override the defaults. Modules that are required for compiling and
running are also defined in the config/mh-<OS>.

Make:
> build_command

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running
---------------------

The run folder contains the files exp.*, which define
the experiments set-up. Configure automatically invokes the
make_runscripts script, which creates the run/exp.*.run scripts.
These are the 'executable' scripts for running the icon_testbed.

The run scripts include environment specific parameters, such as
the scheduler to use. These parameters are defined in the
config/create_target_header script, based on the environment
information created by configure and is stored in config/set-up.info.
In the create_target_header a set of functions set_run_target_<target>
defines the run setup for the specific environment. The <target> is
defined through the mh-<OS> files via the  config_target variable.
